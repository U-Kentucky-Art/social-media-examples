# social-media-examples
Example of most common social media usage patterns
We will concentrate on Facebook, Google, Twitter and add other examples as needed.
We will also use bit.ly (https://bitly.com/) for URL shortening and tracking.
Google Analytics (http://www.google.com/analytics), Yandex Metrica (https://metrica.yandex.com switch to English at the bottom of page) and Heap (https://heapanalytics.com/) will be used to demonstrate user tracking.
